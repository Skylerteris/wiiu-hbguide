IMPORTANT INFO. Before using our guides, we would like to tell you that if you brick a console, It is not our fault, and we cant be brung up on that.

It is risky to continue, but we always update our guides. That being said, proceed with caution. This is a WIP open source project. It can not be commerically distributed, and only for private use. If it is sold, manufactured, or produced, that is copyright infringement.

This was carefully made by me and my friend. These are tried and tested methods.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If the guide fails, double check. You may have missed a crucial step, CIOS, or a file.

If you did not miss anything, check if we have posted any updates on our github pages. We may have got a fact wrong.

Or, If all else fails, you can try a different method. There is no obligation to use Skyybrew.

END MESSAGE: 

We hope you find enjoyment & fun with our guides, as we have them while making these for you. 

We will NEVER help you on piracy. Piracy is a crime and you can be heavily punished. Do not attempt to ask for help on stolen software.
