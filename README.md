This is our readme. Before using our guides, we would like to tell you that if you brick a console, It is not our fault, and we cant be brung up on that.

It is risky to continue, but we always update our guides. That being said, proceed with caution. This is a WIP open source project. It can not be commerically distributed, and only for private use. If it is sold, manufactured, or produced, that is copyright infringement.

This was carefully made by me and my friend. These are tried and tested methods.

Have a great day, and follow our guides for more. Thank you
