# Autobooting Tiramisu
In the current version of Tiramisu, you need to load Health and Safety Information **every single time** you want to boot CFW. Annoying, I know!

## How to Autoboot
1️⃣ Boot into the Wii U Menu and launch Health and Safety Information while holding X.\
2️⃣ Navigate with the D-Pad to `installer` and press A to launch it.\
3️⃣ Press A on `Check` and select `Boot options`.\
4️⃣ You will be asked to change the boot title, select `Switch to PayloadLoader` and press A.\
5️⃣ Press A to shut down your Wii U.

PayloadLoader will now load when you boot up your Wii U.\
Navigate with the D-Pad to `tiramisu` and press Y, then press A to launch it. Tiramisu will then automatically boot when you start your console.

?> If you wish to boot into the vWii or the homebrew launcher, hold (+) on the gamepad while booting.

Congratulations! Tiramisu is now officially set up.
