First off, making a NAND backup is very useful. It can save you from harm you do to your system, import it on emulators, etc. This is optional, but please do as we say and make a NAND backup.

Once again, revisit wiiuexploit.xyz , Like before, click run exploit again. Hold down B on your gamepad when you see the white wii u loadscreen. You will see two options, instead of pressing default, press nandbackup.

You can backup whatever you wish, but i recommend selecing all of them (moving joystick to yes). This will begin to backup your NAND. After it has done backup-ing your nand, you should be able to see the wii u menu again. Power off the console and eject the SD Card.

On your computer, you should see the SD card with a bunch of MLC.part420.bin (example) files. Move them all to a safe folder on your Hard Drive called WiiU nand.
