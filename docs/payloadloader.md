# PayloadLoader

Now that we have a NAND backup, we can install PayloadLoader onto your Wii U.

!> Installing PayloadInstaller does permanent modifications to your console that a factory reset **can not** reverse.

## Installing It
1️⃣ Execute the [browser exploit](/browser) previously mentioned, but instead of holding B, hold X.\
2️⃣ You should be on a menu like this:

Use the D-Pad on your gamepad to select `installer` and then press A to launch it.

3️⃣ Press A to check if you can install EnvironmentLoader.
- It should tell you that it can be installed to `Health and Safety Information`.

4️⃣ Press the A button again to select `Install / Update`.\
5️⃣ You'll get a confirmation on whether you want to install PayloadLoader. Use the D-Pad on your gamepad to select `Install` and press A. PayloadLoader will install.

Once PayloadLoader has finished installing, power off your Wii U.
