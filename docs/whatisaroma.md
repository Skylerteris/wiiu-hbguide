# Aroma

Aroma is a Wii U environment like Tiramisu. However, Aroma does away with the Homebrew launcher and has many unique features.

!> Aroma is still in beta, meaning it is not fully released. Aroma will recieve regular updates, which means you should check for updates often.

?> You need to already have the EnvironmentLoader and Tiramisu installed. To preform this, follow [this](README.md) guide.
